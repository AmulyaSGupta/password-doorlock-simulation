# Password-Based Door Lock using Microcontroller - Software Simulation

This project simulates a digital door lock system using a microcontroller with password authentication. It is designed for secure access control and was implemented using software simulation tools.

## Project Overview

- **Type:** Software Simulation
- **Team Size:** 3 Members
- **My Role:** Circuit Designer & Simulator
- **Tools Used:** 
  - Keil uVision (Embedded C)
  - Proteus Design Suite
  - Microcontroller (8051-based simulation)

## Features

- Password-protected digital door lock
- Logic validation for secure access
- Simulated microcontroller responses to correct and incorrect passwords
- Real-time simulation of circuit behavior using Proteus

## My Contributions

- Designed and built the entire circuit using Proteus
- Developed embedded C code for password authentication logic
- Conducted multiple simulation runs to verify secure access mechanism
- Coordinated with teammates for testing and integration

## Project Duration

- **Start Date:** 03-06-2024  
- **End Date:** 30-07-2024

## How to Use

1. Open the `.pdsprj` file in Proteus.
2. Load the compiled `.hex` file from Keil uVision.
3. Run the simulation to observe password input and locking mechanism.

## Future Improvements

- Hardware implementation with keypad and LCD
- Adding buzzer alerts for multiple incorrect attempts
- IoT-based access logging
